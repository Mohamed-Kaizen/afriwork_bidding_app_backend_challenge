## Overview

A bidding app backend challenge for Afriwork.

## Preqrequisites

- [Node.js (v2.0.0 or higher)]
- [Pnpm (v9.15 or higher)]

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Kaizen/afriwork_bidding_app_backend_challenge.git
    ```

2. Install the requirements
    ```sh
    pnpm install
    ```

### Setup Environment Variables

Just run `env.ts` file to create a `.env` file with the default environment variables.

```sh
pnpm tsx env.ts
```

Now you can edit the `.env` file to set your own environment variables.

### Setup Database

#### SQLite

The default database is SQLite. So you don't need to do edit anything. Just run the following command to create the database file.

```sh
pnpm migrate
```

#### PostgreSQL

To use Postgres, first go to [Neon] and create a new database (Or you can use your own postgres database). Then edit the `.env` file and set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to your Postgres database URL. Plus go to `prisma/schema.prisma` and set the `provider` to `postgresql`

````sh
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
````

Now you can run the following command to create the database tables:

```sh
pnpm migrate
```

#### Seed Database

The first time you run the command `migrate`, you will notice that it will prompt you to create migration name:

Now you can add seed data to the database by running the following command:

```sh
pnpm seed
````

You can check everything is working fine by running the following command:

```sh
pnpm studio
```


### Run the server

```sh
pnpm dev
```
